    <h2>2020-08-11</h2>
    <p>
    With the current situation of a global pandemic and general distancing, I've found myself working entirely remote and spending a lot more time at home. This has allowed me a few benefits. One being that I can dedicate a lot more of my day to focusing on work. More critical work is completed in the early hours of the morning without interruptions from office socialization. Project updates are submitted in this time and I generally don't have to worry about the little things that people would come to my desk for. Overall, allowing me to do more in a shorter amount of time.  

    A second major benefit has been rerouting excess time to personal projects. My lunch breaks are no longer spent on walks around the office or finding a quite place to read or study. They are spent in my preferred quiet place at home. This all means I'm reading more, working out in the morning without having to rush to get to the office, and actually spending time on projects instead of trying to fit them into a 30 to 45 minute lunch. With that time, I thought I'd start something new.

    <h2>Game Development</h2>
    <p>
    As is the case with most folks who have played and enjoy video games, I've always wanted to make one. I'm not going to call it a dream of mine because if it realistically was I would have dedicated more time to it prior to now. While I have dabbled with Game Maker, Unity, and Pico-8, nothing I've created with those could be classified as anything close to a 'game'. More so broken loops and pieces of games. This project is intended to create a fully functional game that is hopefully entertaining. I plan to go through the process of research and building it while documenting as much of the process as possible.

    Outside of setting up this site, the question of where to start came up. Do I dig up my Game Maker key and install that? Should I download the newest, flashiest version of Unity and try to learn each tool it provides? Or should I start somewhere else? The answer came after reading through a [post on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23742922) for a [game tutorial written by a user named adnzzzzZ](https://github.com/a327ex/blog/issues/30). The tutorial is for a game called BYTEPATH written using Lua. Specifially with the [Love2D engine](https://love2d.org/). It seemed like a decent place to start given that I have development experience (which the tutorial recommends), but lack other skills like art asset creation, audio work, and level design. The plan is to start with this and follow along. Making posts as I complete substatial steps or learn new things. If I run into portions where I struggle, I plan on dedicating time to study and learning that barrier to the point where I can post and explain it. Creating a general line of progress with each post. Similar to periodic Agile demos.

    Completing the tutorial will only be one part of my game development journey. To truely show I understand it, I should be able to use what I've learned to create an entirely original game. Again, following along with what I can, recording and studying impediments, posting when I've learned something new or overcome barriers, and finally posting the created game. I'm not setting any schedule for posts or timeline to complete. I'll work on it when available without a finish line to race towards. This will hopefully allow for a more enjoyable learning experience. We'll see how it goes.
